/**
 * You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
 * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
 * The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
 * The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island).
 * One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100.
 * Determine the perimeter of the island.
